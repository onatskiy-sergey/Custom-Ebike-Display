# Custom LCD Dashboard for Electric Bike

Welcome to the repository for the **Custom LCD Dashboard for Electric Bike** project! 🚲⚡️  
This project is dedicated to designing and implementing a custom instrument panel for an electric bike using an LCD display. The goal is to create a fully functional and customizable dashboard to monitor essential parameters while riding.

## 📋 Project Overview

The idea behind this project is to build a **custom dashboard** tailored to the specific needs of an electric bike. The project focuses on:  
1. **Segment Selection**: Identifying and defining the segments (numbers, icons, symbols) displayed on the LCD screen.  
2. **Custom PCB Design**: Designing and testing the circuit that will control the LCD display.  
3. **Firmware Development**: Writing software to display real-time data such as speed, battery level, motor power, and more.  
4. **Integration**: Fitting the LCD dashboard into the bike and connecting it to the bike’s controller system.

## ⚙️ Features

Here’s what the final dashboard aims to include:
- **Speed Display**: Current speed in km/h or mph.
- **Battery Level**: Remaining charge displayed as a percentage or bar graph.
- **Power Usage**: Real-time power draw from the motor.
- **Trip Information**: Odometer, trip distance, and ride time.
- **Lighting Status**: Indicators for headlight and taillight status.
- **Error Codes**: Displaying error messages from the bike controller, if applicable.

## 🛠 Current Progress

- **Segment Mapping**:  
  The LCD screen is being tested and analyzed to identify available segments (e.g., numeric digits, icons, and indicators).  
  - ✔️ Identified basic numeric segments for speed and distance.
  - ✔️ Icon tests in progress (e.g., battery, headlight, etc.).

- **Circuit Design**:  
  Work on creating a PCB that interfaces the LCD with the bike's microcontroller is underway.

- **Firmware Development**:  
  A simple test program is being written for segment testing and data display.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements:
1. **LCD Screen**: Custom or repurposed from an electric bike dashboard.
2. **Microcontroller**: Arduino, or another compatible device.
3. **Power Supply**: 12V-82V input (based on your e-bike’s battery).
4. **Other Components**: PCB, resistors, capacitors, and connectors for the bike controller.

### Software Requirements:
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
- Supporting libraries for LCD control.
